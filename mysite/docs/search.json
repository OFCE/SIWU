    "text": "The invasion of Ukraine by Russia on February 24, 2022 opens a new world that calls for great cohesion in Europe. The response operates in multiple dimensions, and we propose to analyse the direct consequences of the invasion on the daily lives of Europeans in the short term.\n\n\nThe main channel that we identify, concerning the social impact of the War, is the rise in the prices of consumer goods or services linked to actual or anticipated interruptions in the delivery of certain products imported from Russia or Ukraine. These products are mainly crude oil, gas, certain cereals or oil seeds, nitrogen fertilizers and other products used in industry. There are generally substitutes (of origin or nature) for these products, but the rigidity of supply chains and/or production capacities have led to a rise in prices since (and before) the war started. The partial exclusion of Russia from the Western financial system and the prospect of an embargo extending to gas supplies amplifies the price movement. Evidently, an embargo would amplify it further, with large impacts on prices, and probably also volumes (via quotas).\nThese price hikes are cascaded down to end consumers in the European Union. The price of gasoline at the pump reacts quickly to changes in the price of oil. For other goods, the contracts (between the final consumer and his distributor, between the distributor and the supplier) are complex and can introduce inertia or an absence of transmission. Other prices can increase in cascade such as electricity through indexation or price formation as for the single market for gas or electricity. However, subsidies or price regulations can prevent the price hikes cascades.\n\n\n\nOur methodology is as follows:\n\nWe identify the prices that have experienced a significant increase between several dates, mainly between February and April, 2022, which can be attributed to the invasion of Ukraine. We use Eurostat’s HICP at the finest level of disaggregation according to the COICOP nomenclature to distinguish price increases in (notably) energy, food, housing and transport (next update 17 June 2022),\nWe use Eurostat’s Household Budget Surveys (HBS 2015) to identify the structure of consumption by income quintile (using hbs_str_t223 database).\nWe then estimate the impact of price hikes in euros and in % of income by income quintile for each of the member states of the Union and per product identified using HICP from Eurostat, from which seasonal patterns are removed1 (allowing monthly analysis).\nWe offer an analysis and visualization of the information. Updated and complementary data are accessible at https://ofce.shinyapps.io/siwu/."
