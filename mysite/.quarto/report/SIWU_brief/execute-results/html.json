The response operates in multiple dimensions, and we propose to analyse the\ndirect consequences of the invasion on the daily lives of Europeans in the short term.\n\n## Main channels\n\nThe main channel that we identify, concerning the social impact of the War, is the rise in the\nprices of consumer goods or services linked to actual or anticipated interruptions in the delivery\nof certain products imported from Russia or Ukraine. These products are mainly crude oil, gas,\ncertain cereals or oil seeds, nitrogen fertilizers and other products used in industry. There are\ngenerally substitutes (of origin or nature) for these products, but the rigidity of supply chains\nand/or production capacities have led to a rise in prices since (and before) the war started. The\npartial exclusion of Russia from the Western financial system and the prospect of an embargo\nextending to gas supplies amplifies the price movement. Evidently, an embargo would amplify it\nfurther, with large impacts on prices, and probably also volumes (via quotas).\n\nThese price hikes are cascaded down to end consumers in the European Union. The price of gasoline at\nthe pump reacts quickly to changes in the price of oil. For other goods, the contracts (between the\nfinal consumer and his distributor, between the distributor and the supplier) are complex and can\nintroduce inertia or an absence of transmission. Other prices can increase in cascade such as\nelectricity through indexation or price formation as for the single market for gas or electricity.\nHowever, subsidies or price regulations can prevent the price hikes cascades.\n\n## Methodology\n\nOur methodology is as follows:\n\n1.  We identify the prices that have experienced a significant increase between several dates,\n    mainly between February and April, 2022, which can be attributed to the invasion of Ukraine. We\n    use Eurostat's HICP at the finest level of disaggregation according to the COICOP nomenclature\n    to distinguish price increases in (notably) energy, food, housing and transport (next update 17\n    June 2022),\n2.  We use Eurostat's Household Budget Surveys (HBS 2015) to identify the structure of consumption\n    by income quintile (using hbs_str_t223 database).\n3.  We then estimate the impact of price hikes in euros and in % of income by income quintile for\n    each of the member states of the Union and per product identified using HICP from Eurostat, from\n    which seasonal patterns are removed[^1] (allowing monthly analysis).\n4.  We offer an analysis and visualization of the information. Updated and complementary data are\n    accessible at <https://ofce.shinyapps.io/siwu/>.\n\n[^1]: We use a loess smoothing algorithm giving results close to X11/X13 procedures from Bureau of\n    Census. All codes are available at github.com/ofce/siwu.\n\n# Context\n\nThe most important tensions concerning price hikes in Europe today come from the gas market. Gas is\none the main source of energy in Europe (21.5% of EU's primary energy consumption ; 32.1% for\nhouseholds) and Russia is the main supplier. Furthermore, Gas is relatively cheap: the average final\nhousehold price for kWh is 6.5 cents against 21,6 cents per kWh from electricity. The EU imports 80%\nof its total gas needs, around half of it (43%) from Russia. Other suppliers include Norway (24%),\nAlgeria (13%) and the US (7%). On March 8th, the Commission published a plan (*REPowerEU*) to reach\ncompete independence from Russian fossil fuel \"well before the end of the decade\". However, in the\nshort term, supplier substitution is hard as most of these imports come through pipelines and\ninfrastructures for Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is insufficient. As for now, Russia has continued to\nsupply European countries (more or less, the recent weeks have seen some developments there) under\nthe terms of long-term contracts signed with national energy companies. It has however decreased its\nsupplies in the spot market. Also, the fear of an embargo has had a huge impact on gas prices in\nEurope. Dutch TTF Gas Futures trade since April 2022 at around 100 euros per megawatt hour, against\n20 euros at the same time in 2021. This affects directly wholesale electricity prices as gas is a\nmajor contributor to EU electricity production. Consumers across the European Union have different\nexposures to energy price increases, depending on nationality, income, mode of transport and\ndomestic heating. Households represent a quarter (26%) of final energy consumption. National\nexposures of households to energy prices differ greatly. If we look at energy consumption in housing\nby households, at the EU level, space heating represents according to Eurostat (2019) 63% of\nconsumption; and 32% of energy consumption is provided by gas. However, gas is not used in small\nislands like Cyprus and Malta (0%); and marginal in Sweden (0,3%) and Finland (0,5%), who use mostly\nderived heat and electricity (see Table). On the other hand, gas represents the majority of energy\nin housing in the Netherlands (69,3%) and Italy (51,8%). Although, the need of energy might differ\nbetween nations, especially for heating purposes due to climate and thermal efficiency of housings:\nhouseholds in Malta, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus use far less energy than in Luxembourg, Austria and\nDenmark. Likewise, passenger mobility differs between Italy, Norway, Finland, Germany, France (above\n13 000 km per capita per year) on one hand, and Romania and Slovakia (around 7500)[^2]. Moreover,\nonly 30% of travel distance in Romania is by car as driver against 63% in Italy. Some, but not all,\nof these differences can be attributed to income differences.\n\n[^2]: Odyssee-Mure:\n    <https://www.odyssee-mure.eu/publications/efficiency-by-sector/transport/passenger-mobility-per-capita.html>\n\n![Real price of a selection of commodities](../svg/gcom.png){.graph width=\"16cm\"}\n\nCountries, gas and electricity companies and consumers are affected differently in the European\nUnion through volumes, but also through prices. Despite price convergence due to the evolution\ntowards liberalisation and a single European energy market, national utilities and consumers face\ndifferent prices depending on the contracts signed with suppliers. Most European countries have gone\nfrom oil-indexation to gas-indexation in the long-term contracts signed with gas suppliers. In the\nEuropean Union, oil-indexation represented nearly 80% of contracts in 2005, and only around 20% in\n2019, replaced by gas-indexation. This trend started, and is most pregnant in Northwest Europe\n(Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands). The change is less dramatic\nin Mediterranean (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain). Gas-indexed contracts have not really increased\nin Southeast Europe (Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania) or Scandinavia and Baltics (Finland, Sweden,\nLithuania, Latvia, Estonia). This is important because, in this crisis, oil has not increased as\nmuch as gas (Brent is up 52% in 1-year, 35% year-to-date). Also, consumers might be more or less\nprotected by the contracts they signed with the gas and electricity utilities. There is a trend\ntowards more variable-price contracts, especially in countries like Luxembourg, Slovenia, Ireland,\nSpain, Belgium, Czech Republic and the Netherlands: in these countries, more than 50% of consumers\nhave variable-pricing gas contracts. In Belgium, suppliers have the right to index their variable\ngas and electricity prices monthly and use the indexing parameters of their choice (of course, their\ninterest is to link it directly to their wholesale price so that they do not take any market risk).\nThe government justified the decision in the objective to \"bring the bill closer to the market\nreality\". However, if demand is relatively inelastic in the short-term, this price-liberalisation\nincreases volatility and risk for countries that produce gas as well as, and more importantly in\nthis case, final consumers.\\\nConsequently, the impact on consumers, as analysed in this study, does not presume of the impact on\nthe economy as a whole: the cost of the price increase can also be borne by the state (through\nsubsidies), or by state or private utilities tied by regulations (in France, EDF bore part of the\ntotal cost of electricity price increases). Impact on households might differ according to the\npreferred policy response: freeze in prices compensated by corporate subsidies or direct transfers\nto vulnerable households according to income and/or energy consumption. In both cases, computability\nwill be different: in the first case, for the same amount of additional government deficit, there\nwill be no or less change in prices and income, whereas in the second case both prices and household\nincome will soar.\n\nWe can distinguish several kind of policies that have a different impact on what we measure in this\nreport:\n\n-   What most economists would suggest in normal times is to not touch the 'price-signal' and\n    compensate the poorest households with energy cheques. This would not impact the inflation as\n    measured in this report but the decrease in living standard is partially compensated, borne by\n    the state, depending on generosity of the cheque.\n\n-   One can also stress that the impact on welfare of energy price increases depends both on income\n    and energy needs. Governments can therefore compensate consumers via cheques that also depend\n    both on income and energy consumption in the last months. This does not decrease the price of\n    energy (which would increase demand) but compensate according to volumes consumed. With such a\n    strategy, inflation could remain high, but compensated by the State according to historical\n    consumption: there would probably less winners and losers (i.e. variations in living standard)\n    than with a compensation based solely on income.\n\n-   Alternatively, governments can act to deflate prices via (temporary) tax cuts or direct\n    subsidies, and/or price caps, for all or for the most vulnerable in income and/or energy needs.\n    Price subsidies for all is the most expensive instrument for the state budget, and it increases\n    demand (relatively to other policies) for energy. It is not usually recommended by economists\n    who think in terms of cost/benefits analysis. However, if everyone is preserved from price\n    increases in the short term, it prevents the crisis from becoming a political issue: the truen b\n    cost and transfers are hidden, or a least their discussion is temporarily transferred to, it is\n    hoped, after the crisis (when the true aggregate cost is supposedly known and political\n    discussion does not depend on anticipations).\n\nThis later element has some consequences for monetary policy. By cut price increase before they\nreach consumer price, ones prevent indexation mechanism (pension, minimum wage, social compensation)\nand thus prevents partly so called second turn effects. This then simplify the conduct of the\nmonetary policy as response to external price shocks can't be countered by a restrictive monetary\npolicy. Thus by preventing partially pass through to the economy, at a high fiscal cost, monetary\npolicy can be free of inflation risk and address the slowdown of the economy induced by the transfer\nto commodities producers.\n\n![Energy final consumtion per capita by vector](../svg/tab1.png){.graph width=\"16cm\"}\n\n# Results: general discussion\n\nThe 3 following graphs are displaying the most important increases in prices since the begining of\nthe war in Ukraine.\n\nIn most countries, the COICOP categories concerned by prices increases are transportation especially\nCP0722 which are \"Fuels and lubricants for personal transport equipment\", and various categories of\nenergy for housing (heating, hot water or appliances), in the categories CP0451 to CP0454\n(Electricity, Gas, liquid fuel, solid fuel). In some countries, some food categories are displaying\na sharp increase (especially oils and fat). Tables in the annex are summarizing the most important\nincreases.\n\n![Price increase since War in Ukraine (1/3)](../svg/depuis_wiu_1.png){.graph width=\"16cm\"}\n\n![Price increase since War in Ukraine (2/3)](../svg/depuis_wiu_2.png){.graph width=\"16cm\"}\n\n![Price increase since War in Ukraine (3/3)](../svg/depuis_wiu_3.png){.graph width=\"16cm\"}\n\nThe following 3 graphs are displaying the breakdown by quintile of the impact in purchasing power\nper countries.\n\n![Impact on income per quintile (1/3)](../svg/coicop_l1_wiu_1.png){.graph width=\"16cm\"}\n\n![Impact on income per quintile (2/3)](../svg/coicop_l1_wiu_2.png){.graph width=\"16cm\"}\n\n![Impact on income per quintile (3/3)](../svg/coicop_l1_wiu_3.png){.graph width=\"16cm\"}\n\nCompared to other countries, and due to governmental policies, households in France are relatively\npreserved by price increases. This is also the case in Sweden, Cyprus and Malta, three countries\nthat are not dependent on gas for household heating. In Sweden, use of gas or oil for heating is\nmarginal since 2010 for domestic heating. Oil, which represented 50% of energy consumption in the\nearly 1980s has been replaced by heat networks (that themselves rely only marginally on fossil\nfuel)[^3] and electricity, also decarbonized. National differences in how household are impacted\ntoday are therefore partly the consequence of long-term policies (environmental and/or\ngeopolitical).\n\n[^3]: According to Swedish Environmental Agency, total greenhouse gas emission from buildings\n    (heating) decreased from 9.30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents in 1990 to 0.9 in\n    2018\n    <https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/se_2020_ltrs_official_translation.pdf>\n\nOn the contrary, households in the Netherlands and Belgium, who rely mostly on gas for heating, are\nmost affected. In Slovenia, price hikes in housing are more than compensated by governmental\nmeasures (notably, an exemption that decreased electricity prices by 35% on average from February to\nApril). It is also noticeable that households in the first income quintile tend to be more affected\n(before eventual governmental transfers), in percentage of income. This is not surprising: poorer\nhouseholds tend to consume more energy and food as a share of income. Poorer households, from the\nfirst quintile, are most hit in Greece, Netherlands, Lithuania. This is due mostly to housing\nexpenses in the Netherlands, but food also plays a role in Greece and Lithuania. The next Figure\nconfirms this conclusion. We can clearly see that for all countries (except Slovenia), the impact on\nhouseholds from the first quintile (Q1) is greater than for the richest households (Q5). This is\nparticularly true in Lithuania, the Netherlands and Greece. The difference between Q5 and Q1 is also\ngreater in countries where households are most affected: the poorest households bear the most risk\nfrom energy and food price volatility.\n\n![Impact on quintile](../svg/quantiles1et5.png){.graph width=\"16cm\"}\n\n> **What impact on poverty rates in the European Union (according to Eurostat) ?**\n\n> In the European Union, monetary poverty is defined as belonging to a Household whose living\n> standard (in euros or national currency) is below 60% of the median (national) living standard.\n> The indicator is said to be relative: it depends on the relative position of a Household in the\n> entire living standard distribution. One advantage of this indicator is its simplicity: one only\n> needs to know the disposable income (after tax and social transfers) of a representative sample of\n> households (EU-SILC). Due to controversies around this monetary indicator, Eurostat names this\n> indicator \"at risk of poverty rate\".\n\n> The analysis presented here could deepen the controversy around the monetary indicator. Since the\n> indicator only looks at income, it does not take into account differential inflation for poorer\n> and richer households. If poor and rich households have different consumption baskets (poorer\n> households consume relatively more transport, heating, and food), asymmetric inflation as we have\n> seen following the Ukrainian invasion (which affected heating, transport and food\n> disproportionally) will have different impact on the real living standard of poor and rich\n> households, even if income levels are stable. This impact will not be shown in the indicator.\n> Also, equivalent policies could have different impacts on the monetary poverty rate: a social\n> tariff will generally not be reflected in the poverty rate, while a social cheque will lower the\n> poverty rate. Therefore, there could be a paradoxical decrease in the at-risk-of-poverty rate in\n> 2021/2022 if differential increases in prices are not reflected in the indicator, but social\n> cheques are (since they are included in income.\n\n> This is a well-known limit of this indicator which only reflects income, and not needs. To respond\n> to this limitation, Eurostat added a second indicator, using Material and Social Deprivation\n> approach. In this latter approach, which is gaining weight, a person is in deprivation if he/she\n> declares that he/she does not have sufficient financial resources to access a certain number of\n> goods and services, considered necessary for decent living conditions in Europe (from 'being\n> unable to keep one's home adequately warm', to 'afford an internet connection' or 'a car for\n> personal use', and 'a meal with protein a day'). Persons who are incapable of covering expense to\n> at least five of the thirteen items are considered deprived. Today, if you Google \"poverty rate in\n> the European Union\", chances are that you will click on a study that uses a third indicator: \"at\n> risk of poverty and social exclusion\", which is quietly becoming the main indicator of poverty in\n> the European Union.

The main price increases borne by Austrian consumers concern liquid\nfuels and fuels. Policies include 900 million euros for energy tax cuts over 12 months, energy\ncheques for all and for the poorest (300 euros), and commuting subsidies.\n\n### Belgium\n\nBelgians are among the hardest hit in the European Union if we look at price increases since\nSeptember 2021 (6,1%). Since February 2022, prices have increased a lot less. This is mostly due to\nGas and Fuels: prices have increased early in Belgium, maybe due to the fact that a lot of consumers\nhave variable-price contracts. At first, policy was targeted to the poorest (500, 000 households)\nthrough social energy tariffs and an energy check. In February, a VAT reduction for electricity from\n21% to 6% was announced from March to July (extended to September, as well as a check for every\nhousehold. In March, a 200 euros cheque was announced for oil-heated households and taxes on diesel\nand petrol were reduced. It is worthy to note that, as the crisis extended policies went from\ntargeted checks to decreased prices for all, which can explain why we see in our data price\nincreases mostly in the end of 2021. Despite social energy tariffs, since February, poorer\nhouseholds (Q1) have seen a larger decrease in living standards due to price hikes (0,7%) than\nricher households (0,4%) although the absolute difference is not that large.\n\n### Bulgaria\n\nBulgaria is one of the hardest hit countries in the European Union by price increases since\nSeptember (6,7%) and February (1.9%). This is due to large price increases in fuels and oils. Food\nitems (Cereal, Meat, Milk) have also gone up in prices, probably due to greater dependency to\nUkraine. Also, being a poorer country than average in the EU, the weight of Food and beverages,\nUtilities and housing and Transportation is also higher ; the three broad categories represent\nalmost half of the CPI basket. Within Bulgaria, the poorest households are hardest hit since\nFebruary (2,3%) than the richest (1,1%). At first (October) policy response was directed to\ncompanies in order to cap electricity prices for businesses. In December, a new ruling coalition\nvoted to freeze power and heating prices.\n\n### Cyprus\n\nCyprus is in the low-tier for countries impacted by price increases. Its status as a an island\ninsulates the country from a direct impact of natural gas inflation: as with Malta, the country does\nnot supply households with gas. Price of electricity has gone up, even more than in other EU\ncountries: reduction in VAT (from 19 to 9) only went into effect in May. Although, the country\nimports electricity from Turkey (for northern Cyprus households) and these prices have gone up even\nmore than in the EU.\n\n### Czechia\n\nCzechia is in the mid-tier for countries impacted by price increases since February but in the\ntop-tier since September. Electricity has gone up 17% since September. This is due to policy\nresponses in December when the government (temporarily) exempted electricity and gas from VAT (from\n21%) for households and energy-intensive industries. This exemption could be made permanent for\nrenewable energies. In another concern, the government also want a permanent reduced VAT on energy\n(at 10%): this crisis might impact the long-term level of taxation of energy across a number of\nEuropean countries.\n\n### Denmark\n\nDenmark is one of the least impacted countries since January (and September). If the price of gas\nhas gone up, it represents a lower share of the CPI basket than in other countries. The same is\ntrue, to a less extent, of electricity, which has gone up mostly in 2021. The main policy is a\nheat-cheque for the most vulnerable households, mostly for households with gas-heaters (on a\nper-household basis, thus leaving incentives unchanged).\n\n### Estonia\n\nEstonia's consumers are the second hardest hit by price increases (representing 3,3% of income since\nSeptember, 1,3% since February). Fuels and Heat energy prices have gone up more than 20% since\nSeptember, and Electricity 17%) and the weight of these items are high in this northern European\ncountry (Talinn is at the same latitude than Stockholm and just 80km from Helsinski). The country\nput in place social electricity tariffs since September and reduced electricity prices for all since\nOctober. In January the government put in place a cap on electricity and gas prices for households.\n\n### Finland\n\nDespite being a close neighbor from Estonia, Finland is in the lower-tier in terms of price impact.\nEnergy consumption is high but relies less on fossil fuels. As of 2008, the country has four nuclear\nreactors in two power plants, producing 60% of its electricity needs. Natural gas js not used for\nindividual heating. Domestic heating relies primarily on electricity and district heating (which\nrely mostly on oil, peat and wood). In tems of policy, the government increased the maximum\ndeduction for commuting expenses (density is low and mileages are high). The annual ceiling for\nincreases to tariffs has been reduced from 15% to 8%.\n\n### France\n\nFrance is one of the lowest hit nations in Europe by price increases (and the lowest since\nSeptember). For consumers, price increases for Electricity (5%) were far lower than neighbouring\nSpain (52%), Italy (55%) or Belgium (32%), mostly due to government imposed price regulations. To\ncover the loss, EDF increased its capital by 3 billion euros in March (for a total estimated cost of\n8 billion). Also, Cheques have been emitted for the lower income half of the population. And in\nMarch, a 15 cents discount on petrol prices at the pump was decided by the government. It's probably\nnot a coincidence that broad / not targeted measures were taken during this electoral year.\n\n### Germany\n\nGerman consumers are in the mid-tier concerning the impact of price hikes on real income (1,8% since\nFebruary). Gas prices have not gone up as much as in the Netherlands and Belgium. Electricity price\nincreases (13% since September) has been moderate compared to other countries. As in France, the\ngovernment intervened on the price of electricity, reducing the EEG surcharge at a cost of more than\n3 billion. In Mach, further measures were announced, including reduction in fuel prices though a tax\ncut (30 cents for gasoline) and a 300 euros cheque. Overall costs of policies shielding consumers\nfrom the rise in energy prices amount to around 30 billion euros.\n\n### Greece\n\nGreece is also in the mid-tier in terms of impact on consumer prices. Notably, the price of\nelectricity exploded since September 2021 (64%). However, the government decided on a 60% rebate\ncapped at 600 euros and for households earning up to 45 000 euros a year. This will be financed\npartly on a tax on the profits of energy suppliers. This might have, in part, some of the same\neffects of a regulated price but will not appear similarly in the national accounts, inflation, and\nhousehold income.\n\n### Hungary\n\nHungary is only moderately hit by price increases, despite having a land border with Ukraine. Energy\nprices for households are regulated (below cost) and did not move. Furthermore, a price cap was\nintroduced on retail fuel prices. Price hikes are felt mostly through food prices (bread, milk,\nrestaurants) and cars. Ireland Ireland is also relatively protected from energy price inflation., as\nreflected by the presence of Restaurants and Motor cars in the main contributors. The price of\nliquid fuels exploded but only represent 1% of consumption. The main policy is a 30% tax rebate on\nheat, electricity and broadband.The country also made mean-tested payments to households with the\nhighest cost of home heating, and a 200 euros electricity credit to all households\n\n### Italy\n\nWith France, Italy is one of the countries who suffered the least from inflation since September. It\nis in the mid to lower tier since February. It entered the crisis with low growth and low inflation.\nThe government implemented tax cuts in the gas and electricity sector, and also a 30 cents reduction\nof gasoline through July. Data for consumption share is not available for the year 2015. We used\ndata for the year 2005. Latvia Latvia has seen an important impact of price increases (6,8% of\nincome since September, 2,2% since February). Since February, half is due to personal transport,\nwhich went up 14% (28% since September) and represent 7% of the consumer basket. Policies consist\nmainly in reducing the price of electricity.\n\n### Lithuania\n\nNot surprisingly, Lithuania is in a similar situation as Latvia. Transportation cost went up by the\nsame amounts and have the same weight in consumption. During the crisis, the government decided to\npostpone the liberalisation of the energy market. It is noteworthy that impact on income since\nFebruary is much higher for poorer households (2,6%) than richer (0,8%).\n\n### Luxembourg\n\nLuxembourg consumers were averagely hit by price increases. Since September, natural gas prices\nexploded (+58%) but weight in consummation basket is moderates (2%). As elsewhere, poorer households\n(1.6% of income) are more impacted than richer (0,8%).\n\n### Malta\n\nMalta is one of the least impacted countries in the European Union. As for Cyprus, it does not use\nnatural gas for domestic heating. The energy provided is regulated and prices frozen. Price\nincreases for consumers concern mainly food items.\n\n### Netherlands\n\nThe Netherlands is perhaps both the most deregulated country in the European Union and the hardest\nhit by energy price inflation (3,4% since February, 8,3% since September). The main price hikes come\nfrom electricity (+112% since September) and Gas (+98%). Many consumers have variable price\ncontracts and spot and future prices exploded. Also, the government is less prone to alter the price\nmechanism than in other countries. Tax cuts are only in effect since April 2022 (when other\ngovernments intervened in September and other did not need to intervene due to frozen prices).\n\n### Poland\n\nPoland shares the largest frontier with Ukraine in the European Union and hosts the most refugees.\nIt is also in the top tier in terms of impact of prices on income (+2,2% since February, 6,2% since\nSeptember). Gas prices, fuels, petrol increased severely. Since January, VAT is reduced on food,\ngas, petrol and heating. A cheque provides a maximum of 100 euros per person depending on income and\ntype of heating.\n\n### Portugal\n\nPortugal is in the low-tier in terms of impact on consumers, which comes half from food, half from\ntransportation (petrol). Energy tariffs for household consumers are regulated and are anticipated to\ndecrease in 2022 relative to 2021. An Autovaucher reimburses up to 5 euros (20 since April) per\nmonth from petrol purchases (bank account reimbursement for those using the special Autovoucher\ncard). This will probably be accounted for as a household transfer (see box).\n\n### Romania\n\nRomania is a southern neighbour to Ukraine and consumers suffer an average impact on prices, mostly\nfrom Gas, Petrol and Food: main contributors are not concentrated. Bread prices went up by 10% since\nSeptember, which hurts the poorest households. Prices decreased real income of the poorest\nhouseholds by 2,6% since February against 1,1% for the richest. The government announced\ncompensations for Electricity and gas. Government will compensate 4 lei per kw for households who\nrespect a consumption limit.\n\n### Slovakia\n\nSlovakia is a mid-tier country in terms of impact on prices, with moderate contributions across the\nboard: Gas, Petrol, Heat, Electricity but also Bread and cereals. Price hikes hurt poorest\nhouseholds (1,5%) more than the richest (0,9%). Policy is mostly targeted to electricity prices,\nthrough a deal with the national company.\n\n### Slovenia\n\nSlovenia is one of the lowest hit country in the European union, including price decreases since\nFebruary. There are, however, a lot of monthly variability. Gasoline prices were caped in March and\nfrom February to end of April households were exempt from paying electricity bills and excise duties\non electricity (Bruegel).\n\n### Spain\n\nSpain is in the top tier for price impact on consumer income (2,2% of income since February, 6,3%\nsince September). The main contributor is Electricity followed by Transportation (Petrol). The\npoorest households are hit almost three times as much as the richest (3,2% vs 1,3%). VAT was\ndecreased on electricity according to consumption. A heating social bonus was also passed. In March\nSpain obtained permission from EU to get the status of energy island, which will enable to reduce\nthe role of gas in the price mechanism in the electricity market, and introduce regulated rates.\n\n### Sweden\n\nSince February, price increases have a moderate impact on income in Sweden, mostly through\nElectricity and Petrol. Sweden does not use natural gas in housing heating anymore (replaced with\ndistrict heating and electricity). Tax on diesel and petrol were reduced since June. Housing and\nChild allowances were increased.\n\n\\newpage\n\n# Annexes\n\n## Main effect per countries\n\n![](../svg/annex_1.png){.annex width=\"17cm\"}\n\n![](../svg/annex_2.png){.annex width=\"17cm\"}\n\n![](../svg/annex_3.png){.annex width=\"17cm\"}\n\n![](../svg/annex_4.png){.annex width=\"17cm\"}\n\n![](../svg/annex_5.png){.annex width=\"17cm\"}\n\n![](../svg/annex_6.png){.annex width=\"17cm\"}\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Figures over a one year period\n\n![Price increase since one year (1/3)](../svg/depuis_1y_1.png){.graph width=\"17cm\"}\n\n![Price increase since one year (2/3)](../svg/depuis_1y_2.png){.graph width=\"17cm\"}\n\n![Price increase since War one year (3/3)](../svg/depuis_1y_3.png){.graph width=\"17cm\"}\n\n![Impact on income per quintile (1/3)](../svg/coicop_l1_1y_1.png){.graph width=\"17cm\"}\n\n![Impact on income per quintile (2/3)](../svg/coicop_l1_1y_2.png){.graph width=\"17cm\"}\n\n![Impact on income per quintile (3/3)](../svg/coicop_l1_1y_3.png){.graph width=\"17cm\"}\n",
